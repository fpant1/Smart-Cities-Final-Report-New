A brief introduction to the project. This section should also include either an established or adapted design process students will be using throughout the project (e.g. Pahl and Beitz, V-model, DoubleDiamond, RIBA).

\subsection{Background}
\textit{Detail the background to the project, why it is needed, and the value created}

This kind of thing, expand with stats etc... 'Climate change disrupt weather, especially rain patterns around the world. Communities receive rain less regularly and are prone to droughts. Current water pipe system extremely prone to leaks. 1 tn litres of drinkable water lost each year to leakage in the UK alone.'

\subsection{(Our Company) and Objectives}
\textit{Is the idea clear?
Does it provide value to
stakeholders?
Is that value clearly
articulated?}

Detail who we are/ what we do 

Bullet point our aims as a company

\subsection{Stakeholders}
Add a table of stakeholders and some text like this...

consumer and supplier. Smart water systems can assess in real-time water quality, ensuring safe water across the system. Ensure there's no leakage in the system, and if there is, locate it precisely. Overall, improve management of water system infrastructure.

\subsection{Case studies and Proven Technology}
\textit{Points to evidence of success of similar ventures, reviews market readiness/ acceptance etc}
