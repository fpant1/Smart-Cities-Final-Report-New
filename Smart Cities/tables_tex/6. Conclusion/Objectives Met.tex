\textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Result}           & \textbf{Comments}                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\ \hline
1                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{FFCB2F}2 & The literature review in section 2.1 looks into detail about PHES systems, however, it does not thoroughly cover how they are implemented apart from looking at how they connect to the grid.                             \\ \hline
2                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & The key system components are looked at in section 2.1,2 of the literature review, which details the key components that need to be considered in a PHES system.                                                          \\ \hline
3                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & Section 2.2 of the literature review details the four different methods looked at for modelling such a system.                                                                                                            \\ \hline
4                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & Momentum conservation was the fundamental law selected for modelling and it would be done using Matlab and one of its environments Simulink as stated in section 3.2. This was used in section 4 to impelement the model. \\ \hline
5                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{FFCB2F}2 & The model was validated with very limited data so a sensitivity study was run to make sure trends matched, detailed in section 4.                                                                                         \\ \hline
6                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & Three models were developed in section 4, with each model improving and adding a wider range of input parameters.                                                                                                         \\ \hline
7                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & The model was simulated for the validation study and the efficiency analysis in section 4. The validation study was able to verify the changes and ensure the model was outputing correct trends.                         \\ \hline
8                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{32CB00}3 & Changes in the models parameters were analysed throughout section 4, detailing how design and operational parameters affect the system.                                                                                   \\ \hline
