\textbf{9}   & The reservoirs are shaped as regular cuboids.                              & If the reservoirs have an irregular shape the height may change at a different rate (that isn't constant) and this effect won't be taken into account.       &        \cite{improvedmomentummodel}       \\ \hline
\textbf{10}   & The mass flow rate for generating is positive and for pumping is negative. & There is no limitation to this assumption however, it must be noted that the mass flow rate should only be negated after the actual flow rate is calculated. & \textbf{}     \\ \hline
